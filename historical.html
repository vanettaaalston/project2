   <h2> The Historical facts are that 
<li>Cities of ancient times were often noxious places, fouled by human wastes and debris. Beginning about 1000 ce, the use of coal for fuel caused considerable air pollution, and the conversion of coal to coke for iron smelting beginning in the 17th century exacerbated the problem.</li>
  <li>By the middle of the 20th century, an awareness of the need to protect air, water, and land environments from pollution had developed among the general public</li>
  <li> Through the 19th century, water and air pollution and the accumulation of solid wastes were largely problems of congested urban areas. </li>
